Things to do:
- Now python is compiled after petsc. But petsc configuration requires
  python! This means that we are assuming that the user has his own
  version of python installed system-wise. It is better to compile
  python at the beginning, and use it to configure petsc!
[DONE, mf, Friday 4th May 2007]

- set PYTHONHOME (to be empty, or set ourselves): on Hans' machine
  this was set and was interfering with the building process!

- add symlinks for sundials. The current version does not create
  libsundials*.so: it creates libsundials*

- parmetis path in some Makefile (mpi_petsc)

- decide between the -shared (gcc linux) and -bundle (gcc Mac OS) flags

- on Mac OS we need to link against lapack and blas explicitely
