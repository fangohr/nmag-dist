# If the compilation of Nmag fails on your system, you are encouraged to use
# this script to generate a bug report, which may help the Nmag developers to
# understand the bug and fix it. Use it in this way:
#
#   cd nmag-0.1 # enter the directory where your Nmag distribution is 
#   ./build-bug-report
#
# The command will create an archive (i.e. a file named bug-report.tgz)
# containing information about the status of the compilation of Nmag, plus some
# details about your system (processor type, distribution, etc).
# You should send this file by mail to the Nmag developers, if you want them to
# help you with it.
